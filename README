# Bitlatte.io
This repository is the codebase for the bitlatte.io website. It will remain private as only bitlatte.io developers should be allowed to make or propose changes to the codebase.

## Purpose
The website is stored here so that we can integrate a CI solution that will always push the latest version of the website when it is ready. Also a lot of hosting platforms have made it quite easy to host a react based app/website using a git repo.
