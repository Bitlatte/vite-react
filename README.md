# Vite-React
This is a boilerplate React app with Vite instead of create-react-app.
it results in a smaller bundle size and faster performance. Plus it is
pre-loaded with a bunch of extra goodies and is still smaller in
comparison to create-react-app

## Included With Vite-React
- WindiCSS
- React Router
- React Icons
- Typescript Support

## How to use
For now just clone the repo but I am working on a cli that will give you
more options on how the project is configured out of the box.

```sh
$> git clone https://github.com/Bitlatte/vite-react.git
```
