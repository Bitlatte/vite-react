# Vite-React
This is a boilerplate React app with Vite instead of create-react-app.
it results in a smaller bundle size and faster performance. Plus it is
pre-loaded with a bunch of extra goodies and is still smaller in
comparison to create-react-app

## Included With Vite-React
- WindiCSS
- React Router
- React Icons
- Typescript Support

## How to use
To get started us the @bitlatte/react npx command:

```sh
$> npx @bitlatte/react <project_name>
```

Then follow the instructions on screen.

## TypeScript
By default this project has TypeScript support. It is best practice to
use TypeScript since it provides amazing type checking to make sure
your code is as error free as possible before shipping to production.
