# Vite-React
This is a boilerplate React app with Vite instead of create-react-app.
it results in a smaller bundle size and faster performance. Plus it is
pre-loaded with a bunch of extra goodies and is still smaller in
comparison to create-react-app

## Included With Vite-React
- WindiCSS
- React Router
- React Icons
- Typescript Support

## How to use
To get started simply clone the repo replacing \<project_name\> with any
name you desire:

```sh
$> git clone https://github.com/Bitlatte/vite-react.git <project_name>
```

then cd into the new directory and run the following commands:

```sh
$> npm install
$> npm run dev
```

Once you have completed those steps you should have a development server
running on port 3000 on your local machine and you're ready to start
developing your project!

#### Example
```sh
$> git clone https://github.com/Bitlatte/vite-react.git example
$> cd example
$> npm install
$> npm run dev
```
